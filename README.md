# Topic Modelling - A workflow for the Humaninities

As digitally available textual repositories are becoming larger and larger, the relevance of distant reading for the humanities has grown exponentially. As a direct consequence, humanities scholars are more and more confronted with the challenge of having to apply quantitative approaches in their research, for traditional close reading methods are no longer suitable for the analysis of such unprecedented mass of digital data. One such quantitative approach is Topic Modelling (TM), a computational, statistical method to discover patterns and topics in large collections of unstructured text. While there are many TM programs and tutorials available, what appears to be still missing is a description of a generalizable TM workflow for the humanities. With this repository, the **DHARPA Project** aims to offer a step-by-step guidance for a versatile method that could be applied transversely across different datasets. Specifically, it provides a way to enrich the distant reading technique of TM with the qualitative information necessary for contextualising the TM results and opening up avenues for interpretation. An example of how this method has been used for humanities research can be found in [Viola and Verheul](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqz068/5601610) (2019).
