# Topic Modelling - A workflow for the Humanities

As digitally available textual repositories are becoming larger and larger, the relevance of distant reading for the humanities has grown exponentially. As a direct consequence, humanities scholars are more and more confronted with the challenge of having to apply quantitative approaches in their research, for traditional close reading methods are no longer suitable for the analysis of such unprecedented mass of digital data. One such quantitative approach is Topic Modelling (TM), a computational, statistical method to discover patterns and topics in large collections of unstructured text. While there are many TM programs and tutorials available, what appears to be still missing is a description of a generalizable TM workflow for the humanities. With this repository, the **DHARPA Project** aims to offer a step-by-step guidance for a versatile method that could be applied transversely across different datasets. Specifically, it provides a way to enrich the distant reading technique of TM with the qualitative information necessary for contextualising the TM results and opening up avenues for interpretation. This workflow is based on [Viola and Verheul](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/llc/fqz068/5601610) (2019).

## The DHARPA Project
While the ‘digital humanities moment’ has yielded great accomplishments and enthusiastic interdisciplinary cooperations across the humanities and between the humanities and the sciences, concerns have been raised about the little transparency in digital practices as well as the difficulty of replicating studies precisely due to the lack of data access, unclear methodological processes, or standardised practices (Faull et al 2016; Jakacki et al 2016, 2015; O’ Sullivan 2019). Such concerns have for instance led scholars to claim that digital humanities is still in “search of a methodology” (Dobson 2019) and the metaphor of the 'black box' has started to be used (Smith 2014) to describe the lost of human agency in the digital reseach process. Historical inquiry itself has in some ways been like a “Mechanical Turk,” with the decisions and interventions made by the researcher hidden from view and only the well-oiled and seemingly autonomous product on display. The DHARPA Project (Digital History Advanced Research Projects Accelerator) aims to reverse this trend. We want to encourage historians and digital humanities scholars to lift the lid, to show how the application of their expertise works in tandem with technology to produce knowledge, how even digitally enabled research is not a product but a process, reliant on the critical engagement of the scholar. We, the DHARPA team, are building more than just a bigger toolbox. We are building a software to self-reflexively examine the interaction of technology and humanities practice.   

## Topic Modelling
Before talking about topic modelling and how it works, it is worth spending a few words on what is intended by *topic*. This will also help to clarify how the topic modelling algorithm works and how we should treat the output.
