These files contain the visualisations that are displayed in the topic modelling notebook.
This was a second experiment to include visualisations created in React within a notebook.
It works fine but the set-up is too complicated (it requires to add many files in the notebook) and time-consuming to use.
Since then, things can be done with the new "prototyping interface".
