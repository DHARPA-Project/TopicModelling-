# MLOps - Topic Modeling

## About the project 
The project MLOps - Topic Modeling aims at deploying a topic modeling workflow with an MLOps approach.<br>
As an underlying workflow, we selected the project <i>Topic Modelling with Gensim. A workflow for the Humanities</i> available under the following repo: https://github.com/DHARPA-Project/TopicModelling- (1). The reference materials that we used were forked in the "reference" directory of the current project.
